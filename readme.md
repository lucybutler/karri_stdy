# N-Back Tutorial

This tutorial covers creating an n-back task using timeline variables and dynamic parameters. The techniques covered here are probably useful in circumstances where you want to generate a sequence of trials that have some dependencies (like the current trial must sometimes be the same as the trial two items ago) and don't want to manually code a fixed sequence of items.

## Full experiment

The video tutorial walks through setting up the n-back task but doesn't go through setting up instructions or showing the participant their data at the end. The `full-experiment.html` code adds both of these features. You can try the [full experiment here](https://jspsych.github.io/tutorials/n-back/full-experiment.html).
